\begin{problem}{1}
\end{problem}

Recall that $\Sigma_b^+$ is a one-sided shift map. That is,
\begin{align*}
\Sigma_b^+ = \{x = (x_k)_{k=0}^{\infty} : x_k \in \{0, \cdots b-1\}\}
\end{align*}

The shift map $\sigma: \Sigma_b^+ \to \Sigma_b^+$ is defined as follows:
\begin{align*}
\sigma((x_k)_{k=0}^{\infty}) = (x_{k+1})_{k = 0}^{\infty}
\end{align*}

That is, we are essentially cutting off the first element of the sequence.\\

Lastly, we have that,
\begin{align*}
d(x, y) = d_{\theta}(x, y) = \begin{cases}
      0 & \text{if} \; x = y \\
      \theta^{\min \{k: x_k \neq y_k\}} & \text{if} \; x \neq y
    \end{cases}
\end{align*}

where $0 < \theta < 1$.\\

We will start now by proving that $\sigma$ has sensitive dependence.\\

Now fix $x = (x_0x_1x_2\cdots) \in \Sigma_b^+$ and let $\delta > 0$. Fix $k \in \mathbb{N}$ such that it is the smallest natural number with $\theta^k < \delta$. Now define $y$ such that $y_i = x_i$ for $0 \leq i \leq k-1$ and such that, for every index $i > k$, we have $y_i \in \{0, \cdots, b-1\}$ and $y_i \neq x_i$. Clearly $y \in \Sigma_b^+$ and we have,
\begin{align*}
y = (x_0x_1x_2\cdots x_{k-1}y_{k}y_{k+1} \cdots)\\
x = (x_0x_1x_2\cdots x_{k-1}x_kx_{k+1} \cdots)
\end{align*}

This yields,
\begin{align*}
d(x, y) = \theta^k < \delta
\end{align*}

Now apply the shift map $k$ times:
\begin{align*}
\sigma^{k}(x) &= (x_kx_{k+1}x_{k+2}\cdots) = (\sigma^k(x)_0\sigma^k(x)_1\cdots)\\
\sigma^{k}(y) &= (x_ky_{k+1}y_{k+2}\cdots) = (\sigma^k(y)_0\sigma^k(y)_1\cdots)
\end{align*}

Then we have,
\begin{align*}
d(\sigma^{k}(x), \sigma^{k}(y)) = \theta^1
\end{align*}

If we fix $\epsilon = \theta^2$, then we have,
\begin{align*}
d(\sigma^{k}(x), \sigma^{k}(y)) = \theta^1 > \epsilon
\end{align*}

Since $x$ and $\delta$ were arbitrary, this holds for every $x \in \Sigma_b^+$ and every $\delta > 0$. Hence, $\sigma$ has sensitive dependence.\\

Now we will prove that $\text{Per}(\sigma)$ is dense in $\Sigma_b^+$.\\

For a point $x \in \Sigma_b^+$ to be periodic, it must be the repetition for some block of symbols in $\{1, \cdots, b-1\}$. That is, there is some $n \in \mathbb{N}$ such that $x_{[0, n-1]} = x_{[n, 2n-1]} = x_{[2n, 3n-1]} = \cdots$.\\

Now fix $y \in \Sigma_b^+$ and fix $\epsilon > 0$. Then consider the set,
\begin{align*}
B_{\epsilon}(y) = \{x \in \Sigma_b^+: d(x, y)\} < \epsilon
\end{align*}

So for every $x \neq y \in B_{\epsilon}(y)$, we have $d(x, y) = \theta^{\min \{k: x_k \neq y_k\}} < \epsilon$\\

Now let $k \in \mathbb{N}$ be the smallest natural number such that $\theta^k < \epsilon$. Then define the block $y_{[0, k-1]}$ using elements of $y$. Next, define $x_k = y_k + 1 \mod b$. Let $x_y = (y_{[0, k-1]}x_ky_{[0, k-1]}x_ky_{[0, k-1]}x_k\cdots) = (y_0y_1\cdots y_{k-1}x_ky_0y_1\cdots y_{k-1}x_k\cdots)$. Clearly we have,
\begin{align*}
d(x_y, y) &= \theta^k < \epsilon
\end{align*}

Moreover, we have that $x_{[0, k]} = x_{[k+1, 2k+1]} = x_{[2k+2, 3k+2]} = \cdots$. So we have that,
\begin{align*}
\sigma^{k+1}(x) = x
\end{align*}

Hence, $x$ is a periodic point with period $k+1$.\\

Since $\epsilon > 0$ and $y \in \Sigma_b^+$ were arbitrary, this holds for any $y \in \Sigma_b^+$ with any choice of $\epsilon > 0$. Hence, we have Per($\sigma$) is dense in $\Sigma_b^+$.\\

Lastly we need to show that $\sigma$ is topologically transitive. That is, $\exists x \in \Sigma_b^+$ such that the orbit $O(x) = \{\sigma^n(x) : n \in \mathbb{N}_0\}$ of $x$ is dense in $\Sigma_b^+$.\\

Define $x$ to be the sequence of all valid $n$ blocks in $\Sigma_b^+$. That is, for every valid block of symbols in $\Sigma_b^+$, such as $z_1z_2z_3\cdots z_n$, this block is contained somewhere in $x$. The number of valid blocks is countable because for each block size $n$, there are a finite number of combinations. Hence, $x$ is essentially a countable union of finite sets and thus is countable. As a result, $x$ is a valid element of $\Sigma_b^+$.\\

Now fix $y \in \Sigma_b^+$. Let $\epsilon > 0$ and define $k \in \mathbb{N}$ such that it is the smallest natural number such that $\theta^k < \epsilon$.\\

Now consider the first $k$ elements of $y$. That is,
\begin{align*}
y_{[0, k-1]} = y_0y_1\cdots y_{k-1}
\end{align*}

We have that $y_{[0, k-1]}$ is a $k$-block in $\Sigma_b^+$ and that $x$ contains every possible block at some point in the sequence. So we know we can apply $\sigma$ some number $m$ times which yields,
\begin{align*}
\sigma^m(x)_{[0, k-1]} = y_{[0, k-1]}
\end{align*}

Then we have that,
\begin{align*}
d(\sigma^m(x), y) = \theta^k < \epsilon
\end{align*}

So we have $\sigma^m(x) \in B_{\epsilon}(y)$. Since $y \in \Sigma_b^+$ and $\epsilon > 0$ were arbitrary, this holds for any $y \in \Sigma_b^+$ with any choice $\epsilon > 0$. Hence, we have that $O(x)$ is dense in $\Sigma_b^+$.\\

Hence, we have that $\sigma$ satisfies all three properties and hence $\sigma$ is chaotic.

\begin{problem}{2}
\end{problem}

We have that $f: A \to A$ and $g: B \to B$ are continuous maps on compact metric spaces $A$ and $B$. Recall that $f$ and $g$ being topologically conjugate means there exists a homeomorphism $h: A \to B$ such that,
\begin{align*}
h \circ f \circ h^{-1} = g
\end{align*}

Or equivalently,
\begin{align*}
h \circ f = g \circ h
\end{align*}

In addition, $h$ as a homeomorphism means that it is bijective, continuous, and its inverse $h^{-1}$ is continuous.\\

Now suppose $f$ is chaotic. We know that $\text{Per}(f)$ is dense in $X$. Let $I \subset B$ be a non-empty open set. Then $h^{-1}(I)$ is a union of open sets by the continuity of $h$. Let $K$ be one of these open sets in $A$, and fix a point $y \in \text{Per}(f) \cap K$, which exists since $\text{Per}(f)$ is dense in $A$. But then, $h(y) \in h(\text{Per}(f)) \cap I$. Thus, $h(\text{Per}(f))$ is dense in $B$.\\

Now note that, since $y$ is periodic under $f$, we have for some $n \in \mathbb{N}$,
\begin{align*}
&f^n(p) = p\\
\implies &g^n(h(p)) = h(f^n(p)) = h(p)
\end{align*}

Hence, $h(\text{Per}(f)) \subset \text{Per}(g)$. Since $h(\text{Per}(f))$ is dense in $B$, we must then have that $\text{Per}(g)$, as required.\\

We also know that $f$ is topologically transitive. That is, $\exists x \in A$ such that $O(x)$ is dense in $A$.\\

Fix $y \in B$. Let $\epsilon > 0$ and consider the open set $B_{\epsilon}(y)$. Now fix $J$ as an open set in $B$ such that $J \cap B_{\epsilon}(y) = \emptyset$. We want to show that $g^n(y) \in I$ for some $n \in \mathbb{N}$.\\

Since $h$ is continuous, then $h^{-1}(J)$ maps to a union of open sets in $A$. In addition, since $h$ is surjective, we have that $h^{-1}(J)$ is non-empty. Let $L$ be one of the open sets in $h^{-1}(J)$. We also have $h^{-1}(B_{\epsilon}(y))$ is a union of open sets in $A$. Let $K$ be one of these open sets.\\

By the transitivity of $f$, we can find an $n$ and a $x \in K$ with $f^n(x) \in L$. Let $y = h(x)$. Then $x \in I$ and $g^n(y) = g^n(h(x)) = h(f^n(x)) \in h(L) \subset J$.\\

Hence, for any open set in $B$, we can find an $n$ such that $g^n(y)$ is in that open set. Thus, $O(y)$ is dense in $B$ and $g$ is topologically transitive.\\

Lastly, we need to show that the sensitive dependence on initial conditions of $f$ implies the same for $g$.

\begin{problem}{3}
\end{problem}

Let $f_{\mu} = \mu x(1-x)$ where $\mu > 2 + \sqrt{5}$. Recall that sensitive dependence on initial conditions means there exists $\epsilon > 0$ such that for all $x \in X$ and all $\delta > 0$, there exists $y \in X$ with $d(x,y) < \delta$ and there exists $n \in \mathbb{N}$ such that $d(f^n(x), f^n(y)) \geq \epsilon$.\\

Let us now see if there are multiple fixed points for $f_{\mu}$. We clearly have that,
\begin{align*}
0 = \mu \cdot 0(1 - 0) = f_{\mu}(0)
\end{align*}

So then $x = 0$ is a fixed point of $f_{\mu}$. In addition, we have,
\begin{align*}
f_{\mu}(1 - \frac{1}{\mu}) &= \mu \cdot (1 - \frac{1}{\mu}) \cdot (1 - (1 - \frac{1}{\mu})\\
&= (\mu - 1) \cdot (\frac{1}{\mu})\\
&= 1 - \frac{1}{\mu}
\end{align*}

Hence, we have that $1 - \frac{1}{\mu}$ is a fixed point of $f_{\mu}$ as well. Note that,
\begin{align*}
1 - \frac{1}{\mu} &> 1 - \frac{1}{2 + \sqrt{5}}\\
&= 3 - \sqrt{5}\\
\end{align*}

So $3 - \sqrt{5} \approx 0.7639 < 1 - \frac{1}{\mu} < 1$ for every $\mu > 2 + \sqrt{5}$. Hence, both $0$ and $1 - \frac{1}{\mu}$ are in the interval of interest $[0, 1]$ for every choice of $\mu > 2 + \sqrt{5}$.\\

As a result, $f_{\mu}$ has at least two distinct periodic orbits.\\

Now fix two distinct periodic points, $r$ and $s$ so that,
\begin{align*}
d(f_{\mu}^k(r), f_{\mu}^{\ell}(s)) > 0
\end{align*}

for all $k$ and $\ell$. Choose $c$ such that $2c < \min d(f_{\mu}^k(r), f_{\mu}^{\ell}(s))$. Then for all $k$ and $\ell$, and for any $x \in [0, 1]$, we have,
\begin{align*}
2c &< d(f_{\mu}^k(r), f_{\mu}^{\ell}(s))\\
&\leq d(f_{\mu}^k(r), x) + d(x, f_{\mu}^{\ell}(s))
\end{align*}

If $d(f_{\mu}^k(r), x) \leq c$, then by the above derivation, $d(x, f_{\mu}^{\ell}(s)) \geq c$. Similarly, if $d(x, f_{\mu}^{\ell}(s)) \leq c$, then  $d(f_{\mu}^k(r), x) \geq c$.\\

Since $f_{\mu}$ maps the unit interval into itself, for any $f_{\mu}^k(x_1)$, we can find an $x = f^n(x_1)$ with $x \in [0, 1]$ and $d(x, p) < \delta$ for any $\delta > 0$ and some periodic point $p$. Hence, by what we have proved above, we have that,
\begin{align*}
d(f_{\mu}^k(p), x = f_{\mu}^k(x_1)) \geq c > 0
\end{align*}

If we let $\epsilon = c$, then we have proved sensitive dependence for $f_{\mu}$ with $\mu > 2 + \sqrt{5}$.

Under the angle doubling map, we have that,
\begin{align*}
\theta \mapsto 2\theta \Mod{2\pi}
\end{align*}
